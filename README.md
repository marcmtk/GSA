# The Generalist Systems Architect Curriculum

A library for **Instrumental Realism**—not a collection of must-reads for literacy, but a toolkit for efficacy.

## What This Is

This curriculum tracks the evolution of a technical operator into a generalist leader. It moves from the rigorous logic of computer science, through physical dynamics of control and safety, to the messy realities of human organization and geopolitics.

Every text is selected to highlight a specific **Immutable Constraint**—not just "how to do X," but "why X cannot be done any other way."

## Structure

The curriculum is organized into **Layers of Stratigraphy**—upper layers (politics, organizations) rest upon and are constrained by lower layers (physics, code):

- **Layer 0:** The Substrate (Physics & Information)
- **Layer 1:** The Tools (Epistemology & Logic)
- **Layer 2:** The Machine (Computation & Structure)
- **Layer 3:** The Dynamics (Control & Flow)
- **Layer 4:** The Interface (Design & Resilience)
- **Layer 5:** The Agent (Cognition & Agency)
- **Layer 6:** The Social Code (Law & Coordination)
- **Layer 7:** The Organization (Institutions & Management)
- **Layer 8:** The Macro-System (History, Economy & Geopolitics)

## Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Module P** | Mathematical prerequisites (Velleman, Strang, Kline, Strogatz, Blitzstein) |
| **Module M** | The Cognitive Operating System—protocols for learning, retention, and validation |
| **Module E** | Constraint-Based Engagement—how to use the curriculum over years |
| **Module C** | The Collision Matrix—mapping how optimizing one layer destroys another |
| **Module D** | Dampener Design—engineering deliberate inefficiency to survive collisions |

## The Anti-Pattern

This curriculum exists to affect positive change, not to hoard knowledge. Study hours must not exceed deployment hours by more than 2:1 (early) to 1:2 (late). If learning only makes decisions easier, you're acquiring rhetoric, not capability.

## Getting Started

See **Module M: Bootcamp Protocol** for the Day One initialization sequence.
